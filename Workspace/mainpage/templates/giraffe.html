    <p id="hoverText" class="hoverText">Wolves are highly social animals known for their strong pack structure and complex social behaviors. They have keen senses, particularly their sense of smell, which allows them to track prey over long distances. Wolves communicate through a range of vocalizations, body language, and scent marking, maintaining cohesion within the pack. They are adaptable hunters, often working together to bring down larger prey, which strengthens their social bonds and provides food for the entire group. With a varied diet that includes ungulates and small mammals, wolves play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of their ecosystems. Their thick fur keeps them warm in cold environments, making them well-suited for diverse habitats.</p>
